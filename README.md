# LSDJ tutorial for beginners

## Description

Copy of the original LSDJ tutorial for beginners written by Sabrepulse, formatted using LaTeX.

I do not own the original text, this is simply yet another mirror of the tutorial with some minor edits and with some formatting. More precisely:

- Added some section and subsection titles.
- Created a few figures.
- Changed some text to match last \lsdj version (4.8.9).
- Used formatting for inputs or for displayed game boy text.
- Added some text to clarify some parts or give some hints.

With many thanks to Sabrepulse for writing this tutorial! Don't hesitate to check out [his awesome chiptune music](http://sabrepulse.bandcamp.com/).
